Developed a facial recognition project in Python utilizing Data Science and Machine Learning libraries (NumPy, PIL)
and algorithms (Haar Cascade Classifier for face detection, LPBH for facial extraction).
Applications of this project:-

1)Security and Access Control:

  Authenticating users for device unlock (like smartphones)
  Controlling access to buildings, restricted areas, or systems
  Identifying unauthorized personnel
  
2)Surveillance and Monitoring:

  Identifying individuals in crowds or public spaces
  Detecting suspicious behavior or potential threats
  Law enforcement applications (with appropriate ethical considerations)
  
3)Image and Video Analysis:

  Organizing and searching through image databases based on facial recognition
  Identifying individuals in photos or videos
  
4)Human-Computer Interaction:

Creating more natural and intuitive user interfaces
Developing applications for augmented reality or virtual reality
